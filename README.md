# GraphQL Laravel Example

Official link is here https://graphql-laravel-example.tw/

A comprehensive example project to show how to use graphql + laravel in the real world!

## Introduction

I built a simple e-commerce API with GraphQL + Laravel!

Try GraphiQL (the official IDE) here to see all demo APIs: http://graphql-laravel-example.tw/graphiql

You should be able to build any apps with these examples & source code! ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰

## Notes

1. In real projects, you should only enable GraphiQL in the local environment.

2. You can use Github Discussions if you have any questions.
